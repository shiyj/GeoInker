# GeoInker
## App introduction:

GeoInker is an opensource Android program (and soon will be a Mobile -- android,ios,wm&wf etc. app)
which is design to make the normal GIS functions working well on the mobile.

Frankly, this is not an Application, it's an "architecture".

The Geo Database GeoInker used is spatialite which is build by android NDK;
the UI you can see in GeoInker is HTML elements with mobile css instead of the native Android UI;
you may be screamingly for the javascript api provied by PhoneGap and the powerfull js libraries Sencha Touch and openlayers.
